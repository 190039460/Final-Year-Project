                        <p> Specialist noise and vibration engineers are constantly assessing methods to reduce the related challenges to NVH, including stress concentration, 
                            wear, reduced component life and worse friction conditions. This event will address the challenges in design, measurement and analysis of noise, 
                            vibration and harshness in electric powertrains. </p>
