                            Conference for 2025. We are looking for speakers and contributors who can help point the way forward with disruptive technologies and business 
                            models, the latest research, and stimulating and thought-provoking ideas. We are particularly keen to encourage the next generation to both attend 
                            and contribute, with sessions reserved for start-ups and younger researchers and engineers. We will be investing in the future by offering a large
