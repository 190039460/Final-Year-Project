                        <p> The Silverstone paddock is always a hive of activity before a weekend of Formula Student track 
                            events, with the noise and bustle of cars being taken apart and reassembled. But those sounds were 
                            replaced with the tapping of keyboards and clicks of mouses in some garages this year, as more 
                            teams than ever took part in the IMechE competition’s autonomous FS AI element. </p>
